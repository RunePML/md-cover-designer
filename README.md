## 📌 About the Project

When I first got into MiniDiscs back in 2022 and got my hands on a Sony MZ-N707 and some blank MDs, I quickly realized I wanted some cool, custom labels for my freshly recorded discs.
That's when I found the [MiniDisc Label Generator](https://md-label.jkap.io/)—an awesome web app developed by Jae Kaplan.

The app does a great job of creating custom labels, but I found myself wanting even more customization options. Inspired by Jae's work, I decided to create my own label generator. It's still in beta, and although it doesn't yet have all the features I'd like to implement, it's fully functional. Instead of endlessly "perfecting" it, I've decided to release it as is—so here it is!

You can find the web app running here: [https://md-cover-designer.web.app/](https://md-cover-designer.web.app/).
